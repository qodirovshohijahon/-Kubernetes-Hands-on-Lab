### 1. Intro

**Service** - an abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service (thought it’s an internal LoadBalancer).

Using commands as given below, please discover answers to the Quiz.

```shell
kubectl get svc
kubectl get svc -o wide
kubectl get svc --all-namespaces
kubectl describe svc -n <<namespace name>> <<service name>>
kubectl get svc -n <<namespace name>> <<service name>> -o yaml
```

**Endpoint** - a list of backends (pods ip addresses):

```shell
kubectl get ep
kubectl describe ep -n <<namespace name>> <<service name>>
```

### Typical Service Representation:

**Service Key Points:**

- Similar to LoadBalancers, service aggregates pods
- If any new pods had a specific label, the service would know how to send traffic to it.
- Service selector matches a pod label
- Service (usually) has Cluster internal IP (of the same network where Pods are running) and is always avaialable by its name
- Along with its IP, service has other key options:
  - port - TCP Port for incoming connections
  - targetPort - TCP port of destination (backend) pod

**Endpoint**

- endpoint (also ep) is an automatically configured list of backends matched by service selector
- endpoint can have items from outside the cluster (external IPs or domain names)

**Endpoint (ep) is a list of backends**

### 3. Service Type: None - Headless Service

Sometimes you don’t need load-balancing and the single Service IP.

**What about having just an “A” like record with selected pods IP addresses? This is what “Headless Service” does.**

For headless Services, a cluster IP is not allocated, kube-proxy does not handle these Services, and there is no load balancing or proxying done by the platform for them. How DNS is automatically configured depends on whether the Service has selectors defined:

**With selectors**

For headless Services that define selectors, the endpoints controller creates Endpoints records in the API, and modifies the DNS configuration to return records (addresses) that point directly to the Pods backing the Service.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: headless-service
spec:
  clusterIP: None
  selector:
    app: application
```

You don’t need to specify ports for the headless service, because it’s only DNS record, and you will be routed directly to the pod chosen by selector

**Without selectors**
For headless Services that do not define selectors, the endpoints controller does not create Endpoints records. However, the DNS system looks for and configures either:

- CNAME records for ExternalName-type Services.
- A records for any Endpoints that share a name with the Service, for all other types.
```yaml
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 9376
```

Because this service has no selector, the corresponding Endpoints object will not be created. You can manually map the service to your own specific endpoints:

```yaml
kind: Endpoints
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: my-service
subsets:
  - addresses:
      - ip: 1.2.3.4
    ports:
      - port: 9376
```

NOTE: Endpoint IPs may not be loopback (127.0.0.0/8), link-local (169.254.0.0/16), or link-local multicast (224.0.0.0/24).

Accessing a Service without a selector works the same as if it had selector. The traffic will be routed to endpoints defined by the user (1.2.3.4:9376 in this example).

**Task:**

- Create deployment myapp, image: sbeliakou/web-pod-info, replicas: 3

- Create headless service headless-service (ClusterIP=None) pointing to myapp pods

- Create non-headless service normal-service pointing to myapp pods

**Verification:**

**Checking Services**

```shell
kubectl get svc normal-service headless-service
NAME               TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
normal-service     ClusterIP   10.102.42.35   <none>        80/TCP    2m57s
headless-service   ClusterIP   None           <none>        <none>    3m16s
```
**Checking Pods**
```shell
kubectl get pods -o custom-columns=POD:.metadata.name,IMAGE:.spec.containers[0].image,IP:.status.podIP
POD                     IMAGE                    IP
myapp-d968f89cb-4m6qt   sbeliakou/web-pod-info   10.244.0.31
myapp-d968f89cb-n7fvj   sbeliakou/web-pod-info   10.244.1.18
myapp-d968f89cb-sctbh   sbeliakou/web-pod-info   10.244.1.13
```

**Checking name resolution:**
Non-headless service has own IP address (and port), and proxies traffic to backends:

```shell
kubectl run --rm -it test --image=busybox:1.27 --restart=Never nslookup normal-service
Server:    10.96.0.10
Address 1: 10.96.0.10 kube-dns.kube-system.svc.cluster.local

Name:      normal-service
Address 1: 10.102.42.35 normal-service.default.svc.cluster.local
pod "test" deleted
```
Headless service doesn’t proxy traffic to backends, it simply responds (on early dns lookup phase) with the IP address(es) where to go:

```shell
kubectl run --rm -it test --image=busybox:1.27 --restart=Never nslookup headless-service
Server:    10.96.0.10
Address 1: 10.96.0.10 kube-dns.kube-system.svc.cluster.local

Name:      headless-service
Address 1: 10.244.1.13 10-244-1-13.headless-service.default.svc.cluster.local
Address 2: 10.244.1.18 10-244-1-18.headless-service.default.svc.cluster.local
Address 3: 10.244.0.31 10-244-0-31.headless-service.default.svc.cluster.local
pod "test" deleted
```
 Where do you think the traffic always goes using this domain name headless-service?

**Is it usefull?**
- Yes, if you don’t need to have additional proxy in a way from the request originator Pod to the destination Pod
- Yes, if you have only 1 pod - you can simply define custom domain name for it - headles service name
- Yes, if you’d like to define internal (cluster) name for external service by it’s IP
- No, if you can reach external service by domain name - use ExternalName service type
- No, if you have multiple (request destination) pods
