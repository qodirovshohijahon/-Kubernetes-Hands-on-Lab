### 1. Intro

**Service** - an abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service (thought itâ€™s an internal LoadBalancer).

Using commands as given below, please discover answers to the Quiz.

```shell
kubectl get svc
kubectl get svc -o wide
kubectl get svc --all-namespaces
kubectl describe svc -n <<namespace name>> <<service name>>
kubectl get svc -n <<namespace name>> <<service name>> -o yaml
```

**Endpoint** - a list of backends (pods ip addresses):

```shell
kubectl get ep
kubectl describe ep -n <<namespace name>> <<service name>>
```

### Typical Service Representation:

**Service Key Points:**

- Similar to LoadBalancers, service aggregates pods
- If any new pods had a specific label, the service would know how to send traffic to it.
- Service selector matches a pod label
- Service (usually) has Cluster internal IP (of the same network where Pods are running) and is always avaialable by its name
- Along with its IP, service has other key options:
  - port - TCP Port for incoming connections
  - targetPort - TCP port of destination (backend) pod

**Endpoint**

- endpoint (also ep) is an automatically configured list of backends matched by service selector
- endpoint can have items from outside the cluster (external IPs or domain names)

**Endpoint (ep) is a list of backends**
