### 6. Troubleshooting. Case 1

In namespace `trouble-1` we’ve created two applicattions, which show html-pages with some colors.

**We have two URLs:**

- `http://trouble-1.k8slab.playpit.net/lime` - should show “lime” page
- `http://trouble-1.k8slab.playpit.net/purple` - should show “purple” page

Something failed during the deployment and now url addresses doesn’t work as expected.

Please, find the problem and fix it.
